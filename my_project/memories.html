        <h3>For Simran</h3>
        <p>These memories are precious to me, and I cherish every moment we've shared together.
        A lil surprise for you, hope you like it! Hey love honestly… I don’t even know how to explain it without sounding dramatic or cringe lol, but you are literally my whole world. Like, you’re not just my wife, you’re my favorite person(my only person I guess), my biggest flex, my home. Even after all this time, you still make me feel the same stupid butterflies, the same “how did I get so lucky, this bitch is mine? wow”. istg, I could be having the worst day, if you are being supportive as you are :) i make it thorugh. So on Propose Day, I just want to say it again, in the most real way possible… I’d still choose you, after every fight. Every single time. In every universe. No doubt. I’m still obsessed with you(idgaf if you dont beleive), still in love with you, still wanting forever with you. - Your Kuchu Puchu❤️
